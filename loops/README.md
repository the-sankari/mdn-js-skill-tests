# Loops Module - MDN JavaScript Skill Tests

This module contains JavaScript skill tests focused on iteration and repetitive operations.

## Overview

The Loops module covers essential iteration concepts including:
- For loops (traditional and modern)
- While and do-while loops
- Loop control statements (break, continue)
- Nested loops
- Array iteration methods

## Files Structure

```

## Test Topics

### Loops 1: Basic Loops
- Traditional for loops
- While loops
- Do-while loops
- Loop initialization and conditions

### Loops 2: Loop Control
- Break statements
- Continue statements
- Nested loop structures
- Loop optimization

### Loops 3: Advanced Iteration
- For...in loops (object properties)
- For...of loops (iterables)
- Array iteration methods
- Performance considerations

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Open the browser's developer console (F12)
3. Each test file contains specific tasks with expected outputs
4. Follow the comments in each JavaScript file to complete the exercises

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:
- Master different types of loops and their use cases
- Understand loop control flow and optimization
- Learn when to use each type of iteration
- Gain experience with nested and complex loops

## Key Concepts

- **Loop Types**: Understanding when to use for, while, or do-while
- **Loop Control**: Using break and continue effectively
- **Iteration Patterns**: Common patterns for data processing
- **Performance**: Choosing efficient iteration methods

## Common Use Cases

- **Counting**: Iterating through sequences of numbers
- **Data Processing**: Working with arrays and collections
- **Searching**: Finding elements in data structures
- **Accumulation**: Building results through iteration
