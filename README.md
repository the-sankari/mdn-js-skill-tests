# MDN JavaScript Skill Tests

This project contains my practice solutions for the [MDN Web Docs JavaScript skill tests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Test_your_skills). I'm using this repo to learn and track my progress through JavaScript fundamentals.

## 📚 About

The MDN JavaScript skill tests are designed to help developers practice and assess their JavaScript knowledge. Each test focuses on specific JavaScript concepts and provides hands-on coding challenges.
