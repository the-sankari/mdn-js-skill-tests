# Conditionals Module - MDN JavaScript Skill Tests

This module contains JavaScript skill tests focused on conditional statements and decision-making logic.

## Overview

The Conditionals module covers essential decision-making concepts including:

- If/else statements
- Switch statements
- Ternary operator
- Logical operators and compound conditions
- Comparison operators

## Test Topics

### Conditionals 1: Basic If/Else

- Simple if statements
- If/else constructs
- Nested conditions
- Boolean expressions

### Conditionals 2: Switch and Multiple Conditions

- Switch statement syntax
- Case matching and fall-through
- Default cases
- Multiple condition checks

### Conditionals 3: Advanced Logic

- Ternary operator usage
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Short-circuit evaluation
- Complex conditional expressions

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Open the browser's developer console (F12)
3. Each test file contains specific tasks with expected outputs
4. Follow the comments in each JavaScript file to complete the exercises

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- Master conditional statement syntax and usage
- Understand when to use different conditional constructs
- Learn best practices for readable conditional code
- Gain experience with complex logical expressions

## Key Concepts

- **Truthiness and Falsiness**: Understanding how JavaScript evaluates conditions
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
- **Control Flow**: How conditions affect program execution
