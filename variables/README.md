# Variables Module - MDN JavaScript Skill Tests

This module contains JavaScript skill tests focused on variable declarations, scope, and data types.

## Overview

The Variables module covers fundamental variable concepts including:

- Variable declarations (var, let, const)
- Variable scope and hoisting
- Data types and type conversion
- Variable naming conventions
- Best practices for variable usage

## Files Structure

## Test Topics

### Variables 1: Basic Declarations

- `var`, `let`, and `const` declarations
- Variable initialization
- Variable reassignment
- Basic data types (string, number, boolean)

### Variables 2: Scope and Advanced Concepts

- Block scope vs function scope
- Variable hoisting
- Temporal dead zone
- Best practices for variable usage

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Open the browser's developer console (F12)
3. Each test file contains specific tasks with expected outputs
4. Follow the comments in each JavaScript file to complete the exercises

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- Understand the differences between var, let, and const
- Master variable scope and hoisting concepts
- Learn best practices for variable naming and usage
- Gain experience with JavaScript's type system

## Key Concepts

- **Declaration Keywords**: `var`, `let`, `const` and their differences
- **Scope**: Block scope, function scope, and global scope
- **Hoisting**: How JavaScript handles variable declarations
- **Data Types**: Primitive types and their characteristics

## Variable Best Practices

- **Use `const` by default**: For values that won't be reassigned
- **Use `let` for reassignment**: When you need to change the value
- **Avoid `var`**: Use modern `let` and `const` instead
- **Descriptive naming**: Use clear, meaningful variable names
